This package is maintained with git-buildpackage(1). It follows DEP-14
for branch naming (e.g. using debian/sid for the current version
in Debian unstable).

It uses pristine-tar(1) to store enough information in git to generate
bit identical tarballs when building the package without having
downloaded an upstream tarball first.

When working with patches it is recommended to use "gbp pq import" to
import the patches, modify the source and then use "gbp pq export
--commit" to commit the modifications.

The changelog is generated using "gbp dch" so if you submit any
changes don't bother to add changelog entries but rather provide
a nice git commit message that can then end up in the changelog.

It is recommended to build the package with pbuilder using:

    gbp builpackage --git-pbuilder

For information on how to set up a pbuilder environment see the
git-pbuilder(1) manpage. In short:

    DIST=sid git-pbuilder create
    gbp clone https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-libvirt/osinfo-db.git
    cd os-info-db-tools
    gbp buildpackage --git-pbuilder

The upstream tarballs are not used, since they do not contain all the sources
(reported as upstream bug https://gitlab.com/libosinfo/osinfo-db/-/issues/50).
Hence, to generate an upstream tarball you need to use the provided
debian/get-orig-source.py script, which will create one from the upstream git
repository at the latest tag available.
